This is a client-side mod that acts as a companion mod to niwith's [DropinMultiplayer](https://thunderstore.io/package/niwith/DropinMultiplayer/).

This mod is compatible with ScrollableLobbyUI.

## Features
 - `/list_survivors` - Opens a menu of selectable survivors. Click on a survivor to automatically use `/join_as` on them.
	 - Open your scoreboard to expose your cursor so that you can click on it.
	 - Press `Esc` to close the menu early.
	 - Does not activate if you click on a survivor that you already are.

## Known Issues
- LobbyAppearanceImprovements (v1.2.0) will print out an error whenever the character select UI is spawned ingame

## Planned
- Hide selected survivor instead of disabling click
